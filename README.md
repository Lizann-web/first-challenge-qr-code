## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned something new doing this project and that was border radius. Changing the image to have more of a rounded corner. I also struggled to understand the concept of positioning and this project helped a lot with that. When I first looked at it it looked daunting but then I realized that all it was, was a div and an image inside it. Once I figured that out it all became clear and I was able to implement everything I learned. 


```css code I'm proud of
..white-container{
    width: 275px;
    height: 450px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 15px;
    margin: 100px auto 200px auto;
}
.qr-code{
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 12px auto auto 12px;
}
```


### Continued development

In future I'm going to focus on margins, positioning and padding.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This helped me with rounding the corners of the image and container. I really liked this and will use it going forward.
